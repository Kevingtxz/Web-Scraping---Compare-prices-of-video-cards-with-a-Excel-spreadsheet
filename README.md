# Web Scraping - Compare prices of video cards with an Excel spreadsheet

This is a program to compare prices of video cards in Brazil, I made it with Python with Selenium. 
It uses some Excel files with the links to get the prices.

# How it works?

There are some Excel files in the folder, the user needs to fill the file with the links he wants
to monitor and then the program will do a web scraping to find the prices of the entire spreadsheet 
automatically. After that, you can find the prices in the corresponding Excel file with the date as 
the column name.
