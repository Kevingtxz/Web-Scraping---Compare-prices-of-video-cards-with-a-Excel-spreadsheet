# Web-Scraping---Compare-prices-of-video-cards-with-a-Excel-spreadsheet
This is a program to compare prices of video cards in Brazil, I made it with Python with Selenium. 
It uses a Excel file with the links to get the prices, I could make a program to search for better prices. 
But it'd useful for less time, because the sites change and I'll need to adapte the code.
